# Lagged Fibonacci generator

Another cool PRNG that is supposed to be an improvement on the LCG is called the Lagged Fibonacci generator. As its name suggests, it is based on the Fibonacci sequence.


The inputs are:

- *m* the modulus
- *j* a starting number (seed)
- *k* another starting number > j (seed)


To get the next number in the sequence, go back j numbers in the sequence, and go back k numbers in the sequence, add those numbers, and then mod m.

In code it looks like this:
```{r}
k = 13
j = 5
m = 2^4

LFG <- function(n, m, j, k){
  if(n <= 1) {
    return(n)
  } else {
    return(LFG(n-k, m, j, k) + LFG(n-j, m, j, k) %% m)
  }
}
```



```{r}
results <- c()
for (i in 1:100) {
  x <- LFG(i, m, j, k)
  results <- c(results, x)
}
```

```{r, message=FALSE}
ggplot() +
  geom_histogram(aes(results))
```


Note I'm generating less numbers this time because this algorithm takes longer to run.
